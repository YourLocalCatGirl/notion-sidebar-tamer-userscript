## Introduction

The sidebar in Notion is a great way to navigate between pages, but it can be distracting when you're working between windows. This Chrome extension disables the appearing on hover of the sidebar.

## Installation

Please refer to Chrome's [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest) on how to install an extension.
